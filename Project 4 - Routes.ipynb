In anticipation of adding a second planet, change the planet's variable names to **x1**, **y1**, **vx1**, and so on.  Set the simulation loop to run indefinitely, but introduce a boolean **running** variable and a \"start/stop\" button that you can use to pause and resume the simulation.  Change the planet's initial position and velocity to simulate earth's orbit (for now).  Spend some time adjusting the graphics settings, including the size of the planet and its trail (which you could leave as \"points\" or change to \"curve\"), and the trail interval and animation rate.
