Our freedom to choose units means that whatever the actual values of $L$ and $g$, we can simply specify that we're using units in which both of these constants are equal to 1.  These units are called *natural units*. One advantage of using natural units is that \\eqref{simplePendulumEq} becomes simply $\\alpha=-\\sin\\theta$.

To do this, you'll want to embed your entire simulation loop inside a larger **while** loop that loops over the amplitude values, reinitializing the pendulum each time through.  Be sure to adjust the indentation appropriately, and be careful converting angles from degrees to radians and then back again.  If you would like to reinitialize the graph of $\\theta$ vs. $t$ for each new amplitude, you can do this by calling the *delete()* function of your **gdots** object.  Another useful trick is to put a tab character, ``\"\\t\"``, between the amplitude and period in your *print* output.  Check that everything works, so you get a table as intended in the print area.\n",

In this case, it is convenient to use a library called *matplotlib* to draw graphs right inside the notebook.\n",

    "**Exercise.** Change the graph in the last cell to plot $\\omega$ vertically vs. $\\theta$ horizontally, instead of $\\theta$ vs. $t$.  This new graph is called a *phase space plot*.  Use the **xmin** and **xmax** parameters of the *graph* function to set the horizontal scale on the graph to run from $-\\pi$ to $+\\pi$, and then, in your simulation loop, insert some *if* statements to shift $\\theta$ by $2\\pi$ whenever necessary to keep it within the range of the graph.  (This doesn't affect the physics, because changing an angle by $2\\pi$ doesn't really change it.)  Set the **size** parameter of the **gdots** object to 1, and adjust the plotting interval to compromise between a more complete plot and a reasonable execution speed.  Finally, add another GUI button to the program that clears all dots from the plot, by calling the *delete* function of your **gdots** object.  Again, test everything to make sure it works.\n",

Write code to print a few of the more interesting phase space plots, being sure to label them with the drive amplitude settings.  Describe the motion in words for each of these cases.  Also, in the space below, make a list of the drive amplitude values for which the motion is chaotic. "
