While previous knowledge of these topics is helpful, they will be covered  during the course. The course does assume good knowledge of calculus, and some knowledge of programming in Python. "

    "##  Why Python, VPython and Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a computer programming language always involves trade-offs.  Fortunately, there are more choices today than ever before.\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious choice for this course would be one of the traditional computer\n",
    "languages like Fortran, C, or C++.  These languages are widely used for\n",
    "scientific computation due to their flexibility and speed.  The languages\n",
    "are defined by standards committees rather than by commercial vendors,\n",
    "and free versions are available.  However, they\n",
    "have grown somewhat complex over the years, as features have been\n",
    "added while maintaining compatibility with older versions.  Another\n",
    "disadvantage is that none of these languages include built-in support for graphics,\n",
    "and add-on graphics libraries tend to be difficult to install and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a relatively new, free, cross-platform language that scientists are using more and more widely.  It is a simple language to get started with, and developers are creating a growing assortment of add-on packages to make various difficult tasks fairly easy.  These add-on packages include several for numerical calculations and scientific graphics.  One big disadvantage of Python is that every Python installation is a little different, depending on which Python version and add-on packages are present.  Getting someone else's Python program to run on your Python system can therefore be a frustrating task.  Another disadvantage is that most Python interpreters do not produce very efficient machine code, so Python programs tend to run rather slowly---necessitating the use of add-on packages for heavy-duty computation.  Finally, a disadvantage for this course is that none of the graphics packages included in the more common Python installations are especially convenient for creating animated graphics or interactive user controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VPython (short for Visual Python) package is an attempt to address this last deficiency.  It provides a very easy interface to a 3D graphics library, along with some auxiliary functions for handling vectors and animation.  It was created specifically for use in undergraduate physics courses, and it is being maintained and improved by Bruce Sherwood, a physics teacher and textbook author.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook  is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents. A notebook document is a document consisting of both text, and code (usually Python code, but it is possible to use Jupyter with other languages as well). A document is split into cells. Code cells contain code, and the result of evaluating the code appears below the cell. Markdown cells contain text, which is written in \"markdown\", i.e. a lightweight language for creating formatted text. Google \"jupyter markdown\" to find nice tutorials on Jupyter's markdown. A nice feature of Jupyter's markdown is it's ability to format math, for example:\n",

    "\n",
    "- VPython online documentation, available via http://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/index.html.  Although we won't use every feature described, much of this reference material will be essential reading.  Fortunately, it's concise and well written.\n",
    "\n",

If you need to refresh your memory of the definitions and principles from your introductory physics course, the free OpenStax textbooks are convenient references (although any other textbook from such a course will also do).  Volume 1 covers topics in mechanics, while Volume 2 includes thermodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An online introductory physics course is available at https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/index.htm. It only assumes knowledge of basic calculus, and consists of clips that are only a few minutes long.\n",

By far the most widely used reference on numerical algorithms, aimed at professional researchers and graduate students. Well written but quite advanced.  Code implementations are in C++, although earlier editions are also available in C and Fortran versions.  You probably won't get any use out of this book during this course, but if you go on in computational science you'll eventually need a copy (or an electronic subscription).\n",

    "## Installing dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume you are using Windows and have good competence in installing software. If you are using some other operating system, or the instructions here are too terse for you, please contact us and we will help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to install all the dependencies is using the Anaconda distribution of Python. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and download the Python 3.8 Windows 64-bit Graphical Installer. Install Anaconda using the installer. Next, we need to install VPython. Run the \"Anaconda Navigator\" from the start menu. In the left side select \"Environments\". On the right side, in the combobox select \"All\" instead of \"Installed\". Then on the right side, in the search box labeled \"Search Packages\" (not \"Search Environments\") type \"vpython\". Only one package should be found. If it is not already installed (indicated with a green v-shape), click the checkbox and then press the \"Apply\" button on the bottom right. Wait for the installation to complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to install two *Jupyter extensions*. The first is a an extension which will spell check continuously. Every word that is misspelled while editing will be marked red. The second extension will number equations. This will only be used starting from the second project, but let's finish all the installations right now. To install these dependencies, we need to use a command line. On Linux or MacOS, just open the terminal. On Windows, you can launch \"Powershell Prompt\" from the Anaconda Navigator. Now, run the following set of commands:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions \n",
    "    jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n",
    "    jupyter nbextension enable equation-numbering/main\n",
    "    jupyter nbextension enable spellchecker/main\n",
    "```\n",
    "You now have everything needed installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually work on this worksheet you need to run Jupyter server. The easiest way to do so is via the Anaconda Navigator. If it is not open - open it. On the left, make sure that \"Home\" is selected. Then on the right, click \"Launch\" in the \"Jupyter Notebook\" box. A browser should open with a directory tree. "

    "\n",
    "Why bother with such a boring program?  Because the steps required to write and run even the most trivial program can be quite intricate.  For some programming environments you may need to install software, configure the software to work with your computer's directory system, and then learn to use various software tools for editing, compiling, linking, and launching your program.  Then you need to learn enough about the programming language, and about the associated software libraries for producing the type of output you want, in order to type in the code needed to produce that output.  The number of things that can go wrong during this whole process is enormous.\n",

First, download the notebook file associated with this PDF. This is the file with the .ipynb extension. Put it in an easy to find folder. Now, run Jupyter from the Anaconda Navigator (or any other way). A tree should open in the browser. Navigate to the folder where you kept the notebook file, and click the notebook file to open it. Now click on the cell below (the one with ```# Your code here!```), delete the comment and write ```print(\"Hello, Python-Jupyter!\")```.

    "\n",
    "**Exercise.** The following exercise is designed to get you acquainted with the spyder environment. Open spyder, and create a Python program containing the single line of code ```print(\"Hello, world!\")```.  Save this program under the name *Hello.py*, and make sure you know how to run it from within spyder.  Then, go back to your command-line window (Anaconda Prompt or Terminal) and use the *cd* command (\"change directory'\") to navigate to the folder where you saved your program (for example, on Windows, type something like ```cd \\Users\\username\\Desktop```).  Then type ```python Hello.py``` to launch your program, and check that you see the printed greeting."
