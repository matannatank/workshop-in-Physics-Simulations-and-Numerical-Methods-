Workshop in Scientific Computing


This repository uses the Python programming language to explore and implement numerical calculations and graphical outputs.
The key objectives of this projects include:

* Learning to use VPython and matplotlib for creating numerical simulations with graphical output.
* Gaining familiarity with step-by-step procedures for performing mathematical calculations, such as solving differential equations on a computer.
* Developing a solid understanding of how to validate and evaluate numerical code, with a focus on verifying the correctness of implementations.
* Cultivating good programming practices.
* Encouraging an enjoyable experience while engaging with numerical mathematics!
