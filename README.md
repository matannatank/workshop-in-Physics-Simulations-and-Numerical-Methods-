Workshop in Scientific Computing

in this repository we have seve

This repository uses the Python programming language to explore and implement numerical calculations and graphical outputs.
The key objectives of this project include:

* Learning to use VPython and matplotlib for creating numerical simulations with graphical output.
* Gaining familiarity with step-by-step procedures for performing mathematical calculations, such as solving differential equations on a computer.
* Developing a solid understanding of how to validate and evaluate numerical code, with a focus on verifying the correctness of implementations.
* Cultivating good programming practices.
* Encouraging an enjoyable experience while engaging with numerical mathematics!
