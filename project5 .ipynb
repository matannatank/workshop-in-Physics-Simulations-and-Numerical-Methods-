    "# The program design\n",
    "\n",
    "You're nearly ready to start writing a molecular dynamics simulation program.  But there are several decisions to make before you can actually start coding, and to save time we've made some of these decisions for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "First decision:  You'll simulate a collection of noble gas atoms in *two* dimensions, not three.  A 3D simulation would be only a tiny bit harder to code, and you can certainly try it later if you like, but in 3D it's hard to see what's happening.  Fortunately, there's plenty to be learned from a 2D molecular dynamics simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second decision:  The atoms will live in a square \"box\" whose walls are located at the edges of the graphics scene.  So you should set **scene.width** and **scene.height** to be the same; you can decide exactly how many pixels they should be, depending on your screen size.  The $x$ and $y$ coordinates inside the box will each run from 0 up to a maximum value that we'll call **w** (for *width*), measured in natural units as defined above (multiples of $r_0$).  You'll set ``w=20`` initially, but plan on changing the value later.  Then you should set **scene.center** to be at the middle of the box, and set **scene.range** to put the edges at 0 and **w**.  Set **scene.fov** to a small value like 0.01, to eliminate distortion as in the previous project.  Disable auto-scaling, zooming, and rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third decision:  Use the variable name **N** for the total number of atoms; use **x**, **y**, **vx**, **vy**, **ax**, and **ay** for the lists that will hold the atoms' positions, velocities, and accelerations; and use a list called **ball** for the *sphere* objects that will represent the atoms in the graphics scene.  Set N=100 for now, but write your code to work for any reasonable value of **N**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** In the cell below, write a program that implements the design decisions described above.  Use a *for* loop to initialize all the velocities and accelerations to zero, to initialize the positions to a common location near the middle of the box, and to initialize each element of the **ball** list to a **sphere** at the corresponding position, with diameter 1.0, in your favorite color.  Run the program and check that you see a single sphere at the correct position, with the correct size.  (You'll see only one sphere, because they're all at the same position.)"

    "**Exercise:** Now modify your initialization code to place all the atoms at different positions inside the box, so none of the spheres that represent them overlap.  The easiest way to do this is to arrange them in regular rows, placing each atom next to the previous one but starting a new row whenever the old row is full.  We suggest that you place them pretty close together, rather than trying to spread them uniformly over the entire box.  You'll need a couple of variables to keep track of the $x$ and $y$ locations where the next atom goes (or where the last one went).  Spend some time on this task, trying out your ideas to see if they work, but if you and your lab partner can't come up with a working algorithm within 15 minutes or so, be sure to ask someone else for a hint.  Once you get your code working for ``N=100`` and ``w=20``, change these values a few times and make sure it still works---but don't worry about what happens when the box is too small to comfortably hold all the atoms."

    "Here, then, are some tips for optimizing the performance of your molecular dynamics simulation:\n",
    "- Don't spend time trying to optimize performance until after you're sure that your program is working correctly.\n",
    "- Never worry about optimizing code that isn't executed at least thousands  of times per second.\n",
    "- To speed up the force calculations, don't bother to compute  the force between two atoms when they're farther than (say) 3 units apart.  (Be sure  to test whether they're too far apart in a way that avoids calculating a square root.)\n",
    "- The *singleStep* function makes repeated use of the combinations $dt/2$ and $dt^2/2$, where $dt$ is the time step.  So compute these quantities once and for all in your program's initialization section, storing them in global variables.\n",
    "- A brute-force way to speed up the simulation is to increase  $dt$.  Naturally, this will also increase the truncation error.  Don't try this until later, when you'll have a way of checking whether energy is approximately conserved.\n",
    "- Graphics can often be a performance bottleneck.  In VPython, there is overhead associated with changing any of the attributes of a *sphere* (or any other graphics object).  That's why we've told you to use the separate variables **x** and **y** for the physics calculations, updating the **ball.pos** values only once per animation frame.  On the other hand, you still want the animation to be reasonably smooth if possible, and typically this requires at least 20 or 30 animation frames per second.  Try adjusting the number of calculation steps per animation frame, and see what value seems to give the best results.\n",
    "- If you want to monitor performance quantitatively, VPython provides a *clock* function that returns the current time in seconds.  Call it twice and subtract the values to determine how much time passed in between calls.  (Measuring the performance in this way is *optional* for this project.) Alternatively, check Pythons *time* package.\n",

    "\r\n",
    "**Cutoff Distance for Force Calculations**: We only compute the force between atoms that are within a certain cutoff distance (3 units). This avoids unnecessary calculations for atoms that are too far apart to interact significantly. The cutoff distance is tested using squared distances to avoid the expensive square root operation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Precompute Constants**: Precompute \\( \\frac{dt}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{dt^2}{2} \\) to avoid repeated calculations inside the loop. These values are stored in global variables `dt_over_2` and `dt2_over_2`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Reduce Graphics Updates**: Update the positions of the sphere objects only once per animation frame. This reduces the overhead associated with changing the attributes of the graphics objects.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Monitor Performance**: Use Python's `time` module to monitor the performance of the simulation. This helps in understanding the impact of the optimizations and making further adjustments if necessary.\r\n"
